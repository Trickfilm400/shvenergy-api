# shvenergy-api

This project generates an API client for typescript with the axios library for requesting information of the SHVEnergy API.

This package should work with ESModules as well as CommonJS. The code will be generated based on the `shvenergy-api.yml` OpenAPI 3.0 schema with the `openapi-generator-cli`
